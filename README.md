Cobra templates is largely inspired by Infinum VIPER generator (https://github.com/infinum/iOS-VIPER-Xcode-Templates).  
It aims to simplify much of the implementation and remove unnecessary clutter.  
Also, it adds some nice navigation sugar and couples with deep-linking easily through built in routing options.  
This contains MVC, MVP, MVVP and VIPER templates.  Inter-module navigation (the router in VIPER) was
extended for every one of these.  This is a simple utility contained in the original
VIPER generator, which was extended here to accommodate deep linking.  This gives mechanisms
for "out of the box" complete navigation solution.
