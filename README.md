Cobra templates is largely inspired by Infium VIPER generator.  It aims to simplify much
of the implementation and remove unnecessary clutter.  Also, it adds some nice navigation sugar
and couples with deep-linking easily through built in routing options.  This contains
MVC, MVP, MVVP and VIPER templates.  Inter-module navigation (the router in VIPER) was
extended for every one of these.  This is a simple utility contained in the original
VIPER generator, which was extended here to accommodate deep linking.  This gives mechanisms
for "out of the box" complete navigation solution.
